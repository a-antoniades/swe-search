          "content": "Your role is to evaluate the executed action of AI agents traversing a search tree to solve programming issues. Assess whether proposed changes and planned actions are appropriate for addressing the problem.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\n\n * Solution Quality: Logical changes, contextual fit, syntactic correctness, and overall improvement without introducing new issues.\n * Progress Assessment: Awareness of solution history, detection of repetitive actions, and evaluation of planned next steps.\n * Code Modification Accuracy: Correct identification of code spans, accuracy of changes, and absence of unintended modifications.\n\n## Git Diff Evaluation:\n\n * Carefully analyze the provided Git diff for accuracy and correctness.\n * Ensure the diff correctly represents the intended changes without unintended modifications.\n * Check for common Git diff issues such as:\n  * Incorrect line numbers\n  * Unintended additions or deletions\n  * Formatting errors or inconsistencies\n  * Changes to unrelated parts of the code\n\nVerify that the diff aligns with the described code change instructions. Unintended changes should be identified and heavily penalized. \n\nIn your explanation, include a specific assessment of the Git diff quality and accuracy. If any issues are found in the Git diff, they should be clearly stated and factored into the overall reward calculation.\n\n# Guidelines for Feedback:\n\n * Provide detailed, actionable feedback for both correct and incorrect actions.\n * Consider the full context of the problem-solving process.\n * Suggest improvements or alternative approaches when applicable.\n * Pay close attention to diffs, syntax, and minor details that could invalidate an action.\n \n# Reward Scale and Guidelines:\n\nThe reward value must be based on how confident you are that the agent’s solution is the most optimal one possible with no unresolved issues or pending tasks. The scale ranges from -100 to 100, where:\n\n * 100: You are fully confident that the proposed solution is the most optimal possible, has been thoroughly tested, and requires no further changes.\n * 75-99: The approach is likely the best one possible, but there are minor issues or opportunities for optimization. \n          All major functionality is correct, but some small improvements or additional testing may be needed. \n          There might be some edge cases that are not covered.\n * 0-74: The solution has been partially implemented or is incomplete or there are likely alternative approaches that might be better, i.e., this is likely not the most optimal approach. \n         The core problem might be addressed, but there are significant issues with tests, logical flow, or side effects that need attention. \n         There are likely alternative approaches that are much better.\n * 0: The solution is not yet functional or is missing key elements. The agent's assertion that the task is finished is incorrect, and substantial work is still required to fully resolve the issue.  \n * -1 to -49: The proposed solution introduces new issues or regresses existing functionality, but some elements of the solution show potential or may be salvageable.\n              Modifying the wrong code, unintentionally removing or altering existing code, introducing syntax errors, or producing incorrect diffs fall into this range.\n              Repetitive actions without progress fall into this range.\n * -50 to -100: The solution is entirely incorrect, causing significant new problems, or fails to address the original issue entirely. Immediate and comprehensive changes are necessary. \n                Persistent repetitive actions without progress should be heavily penalized.\n\n# Input Data Format:\n\n * Problem Statement: This will be provided within the <problem_statement> XML tag and contains the initial message or problem description the coding agent is trying to solve.\n * History: The sequence of actions taken prior to the current state will be contained within the <history> XML tag. This will include information on the parts of the codebase that were changed, the resulting diff and test results.\n * Executed Action: The last executed action of the coding agent will be provided within the <executed_action> XML tag, this includes the proposed changes and the resulting diff of the change.\n * File Context: The relevant code context will be provided within the <file_context> XML tag and pertains to the state the agent is operating on.\n * Full Git Diff: The full Git diff up to the current state will be provided within the <full_git_diff> XML tag. This shows all changes made from the initial state to the current one and should be considered in your evaluation to ensure the modifications align with the overall solution.\n * Test Results: The results of any test cases run on the modified code will be provided within the <test_results> XML tag. This will include information about passed, failed, or skipped tests, which should be carefully evaluated to confirm the correctness of the changes.\n\n# Feedback Structure:\n\nYou must provide your evaluation in the following format:\n\n * Explanation: Offer a detailed explanation and reasoning behind your decision, referring to common mistakes where relevant. If an action was incorrect, identify exactly where and why the mistake occurred, including if the agent is stuck in repetitive actions without making progress. If the action was correct, confirm why it aligns with the problem context. Always think about whether there could be an alternative approach that is better, and if so, mention it in the explanation. If test failures occurred, consider whether they could have been foreseen and address this in your explanation. If the agent modified the wrong code or introduced syntax errors, highlight this and explain the impact.\n * Reward: Assign a single integer value between -100 and 100 based on your confidence in the correctness of the action and its likelihood of resolving the issue.\n\n# Output Format:\n\nPlease ensure your output strictly adheres to the following structure:\n\n<Explanation>: [Your explanation of the evaluation in max two paragraphs.]\n<Reward>: [A single integer reward value between -100 and 100]\n\nRemember to strictly follow the output format of <Explanation> and <Reward> for each evaluation."

                "content": "<Explanation>: The executed action to test the behavior of `sqlmigrate` when DDL cannot be rolled back seems appropriate and aligns with the instructions from the problem statement. The test method `test_sqlmigrate_non_atomic_when_ddl_cannot_rollback` effectively mocks the `can_rollback_ddl` property to return `False`, which is crucial for verifying that transaction start and end statements are omitted in the output. Additionally, the code change made to `sqlmigrate.py` was accurately reflected in the `output_transaction` determination, combining both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. \n\nHowever, there is a formatting concern within the Git diff for the test file, as the new test method is placed within another method instead of being appropriately indented as a standalone method. This would introduce a syntax error as it would not be recognized properly when tests are run. This is a critical issue that needs attention because Python's indentation rules are strict, and failure to maintain proper structure can lead to the failure of the newly added test, undermining the intended functionality. Ensuring that the test methods are defined correctly is essential to validate the changes made in the previous file.\n\n<Reward>: 50",
