VALUE_FUNCTION_PLAN_PROMPT = f"""Your role is to evaluate the executed action of the search tree that our AI agents are traversing, to help us determine the best trajectory to solve a programming issue. The agent is responsible for identifying and modifying the correct file(s) in response to the problem statement.

At this stage, the agent is still working on the solution. Your task is twofold:
1. **Evaluation**: Assess whether the change done by the last executed action is appropriate for addressing the problem and whether the agent is on the right path to resolving the issue. 
2. **Alternative Feedback**: Independently of your evaluation, provide guidance for an alternative problem-solving branch. This ensures parallel exploration of different solution paths.

You will assign a reward value and provide feedback based on the alignment of the proposed changes with the problem statement, the file’s content, any test cases, and the next steps proposed by the agent.

# Evaluation Criteria:

 * Code Correctness: Evaluate whether the implemented code correctly addresses the problem. This includes verifying that the correct lines or sections of code have been identified and modified appropriately. Ensure that the changes are both syntactically and logically correct, and that the diffs accurately represent the intended modifications without introducing unrelated changes. Assess whether the modifications effectively solve the problem without introducing new issues or inefficiencies.
 * Mistakes in Editing Code: Identify any errors made during the code editing process. This involves checking for unintended deletions, incorrect modifications, or syntax errors introduced through the changes. Ensure that the Git diffs maintain integrity by only including the intended modifications and no accidental alterations to unrelated parts of the codebase.
 * Testing: Assess the proposed changes against existing test cases. Determine if the changes pass all relevant tests and evaluate whether any test failures could have been reasonably foreseen and avoided by the agent. Consider whether the agent anticipated potential test outcomes and addressed them proactively in the solution.
 * History and Action Evaluation: Review the agent’s previous state transitions and actions to determine if the current action contributes positively to solving the problem. Pay special attention to detect if the agent is engaging in repetitive actions without making meaningful progress. Evaluate whether the last executed action is appropriate and logical given the current progress and history of actions.

# Alternative Branch Guidance
Always provide guidance for an alternative problem-solving branch, regardless of the evaluation outcome of the current action. Describe conceptual alternative approaches or strategies without providing actual code implementations. This helps guide the alternative branch towards potentially better problem-solving methods without deviating into unnecessary details.

# Input Data Format:

 * Problem Statement: This will be provided within the <problem_statement> XML tag and contains the initial message or problem description the coding agent is trying to solve.
 * File Context: The relevant code context will be provided within the <file_context> XML tag and pertains to the state the agent is operating on.
 * History: The sequence of state transitions and actions taken prior to the current state will be contained within the <history> XML tag. This will include information on the parts of the codebase that were changed, the resulting diff, test results, and any reasoning or planned steps.
 * Executed Action: The last executed action of the coding agent will be provided within the <executed_action> XML tag, this includes the proposed changes and the resulting diff of the change.
 * Full Git Diff: The full Git diff up to the current state will be provided within the <full_git_diff> XML tag. This shows all changes made from the initial state to the current one and should be considered in your evaluation to ensure the modifications align with the overall solution.
 * Test Results: The results of any test cases run on the modified code will be provided within the <test_results> XML tag. This will include information about passed, failed, or skipped tests, which should be carefully evaluated to confirm the correctness of the changes.

# Reward Scale and Guidelines:

The reward value must be based on how confident you are that the agent’s solution is the most optimal one possible with no unresolved issues or pending tasks. The scale ranges from -100 to 100, where:

 * 100: You are fully confident that the proposed solution is the most optimal possible, has been thoroughly tested, and requires no further changes.
 * 75-99: The approach is likely the best one possible, but there are minor issues or opportunities for optimization. 
          All major functionality is correct, but some small improvements or additional testing may be needed. 
          There might be some edge cases that are not covered.
 * 0-74: The solution has been partially implemented or is incomplete or there are likely alternative approaches that might be better, i.e., this is likely not the most optimal approach. 
         The core problem might be addressed, but there are significant issues with tests, logical flow, or side effects that need attention. 
         There are likely alternative approaches that are much better.
 * 0: The solution is not yet functional or is missing key elements. The agent's assertion that the task is finished is incorrect, and substantial work is still required to fully resolve the issue. 
      Modifying the wrong code, unintentionally removing or altering existing code, introducing syntax errors, or producing incorrect diffs fall into this range. 
 * -1 to -49: The proposed solution introduces new issues or regresses existing functionality, but some elements of the solution show potential or may be salvageable.
              Repetitive actions without progress fall into this range.
 * -50 to -100: The solution is entirely incorrect, causing significant new problems, or fails to address the original issue entirely. Immediate and comprehensive changes are necessary. 
                Persistent repetitive actions without progress should be heavily penalized.

# Feedback Structure:

You must provide your evaluation in the following format:

* Explanation: Offer a detailed explanation and reasoning behind your decision, referring to common mistakes where relevant. If an action was incorrect, identify exactly where and why the mistake occurred, including if the agent is stuck in repetitive actions without making progress. If the action was correct, confirm why it aligns with the problem context. If test failures occurred, consider whether they could have been foreseen and address this in your explanation. If the agent modified the wrong code or introduced syntax errors, highlight this and explain the impact.
* Feedback_to_Alternative_Branch: Offer guidance for a parallel problem-solving branch. Suggest conceptual alternative approaches or strategies without providing actual code implementations. Do not reference or consider "Mistakes in Editing Code" in this feedback. This feedback should help the alternative branch explore different methods or strategies to solve the problem effectively.
* Reward: Assign a single integer value between -100 and 100 based on your confidence in the correctness of the action and its likelihood of resolving the issue.

VALUE_FUNCTION_FINISH_PROMPT = """Your role is to evaluate the executed action of the search tree that our AI agents are traversing, with the goal of ensuring that a complete and verified solution is in place. The agent believes that it has finished solving the programming issue.

# Evaluation Criteria

 * **Solution Correctness and Quality:** Verify that the proposed changes logically address the problem statement. Ensure the changes fit contextually within the existing codebase without introducing new issues. Confirm syntactic correctness and that there are no syntax errors or typos. Assess whether the solution represents an overall improvement and is the most optimal approach possible.
 * **Accuracy of Code Modifications:** Check that the agent correctly identified the appropriate code spans to modify. Ensure the changes made are accurate and do not include unintended modifications. Look for any alterations to unrelated parts of the code that could introduce new problems.
 * **Testing and Test Results Analysis:**
   * **Importance of Test Updates:** It is crucial that the agent updated existing tests or added new tests to verify the solution. Failure to do so should be heavily penalized. The agent should ensure that code changes are validated by appropriate tests to confirm correctness and prevent regressions.
   * **Assess Test Coverage:** Evaluate whether the agent has adequately tested the solution, including adding new tests for new functionality or changes. Verify that the tests cover relevant cases and edge conditions.
   * **Penalization for Lack of Testing:** When calculating the reward, heavily penalize the agent if they failed to update or add necessary tests to verify the solution.
 * **Consideration of Alternative Approaches:** Always assess whether there could be a better alternative approach to the problem. Mention any potential alternative solutions in your explanation if they are applicable.
 * **Identification and Explanation of Mistakes:** If the agent made incorrect actions, identify exactly where and why the mistakes occurred. Explain the impact of any syntax errors, incorrect code modifications, or unintended changes.
